# CodeAlpha_Hangman_Game
Hangman is a fun and simple game where you try to guess a word by suggesting letters. Every wrong guess adds a part to a stick figure, and the challenge is to figure out the word before the figure is completely drawn. It's a great way to test your vocabulary and have a little friendly competition!
